        <h1>Ability:Oathbound Dominion</h1>
        <p><h2>Power: The villain can bind anyone—hero, civilian, or rival—into an unbreakable “honor pact.” Once someone hears and accepts the villain’s sworn challenge or demand (even subconsciously), they become subject to the Pact of Honor. The bound target must follow any direct order that doesn’t blatantly self-destruct, If they try to circumvent the pact they suffer a backlash of pain, incapacitation, or a crippling curse of guilt that grows until they confessThe pact endures until the villain willingly releases the target, the target honors every single clause without fail, or the villain’s own “honor” code is publicly shattered.
            Weakness: The villain themself must abide by their own rigid code—if they break any sworn clause, all pacts collapse instantly, freeing every bound target and turning the backlash on the villain. The power hinges on precise language. If the oath is ambiguous or contains loopholes, clever opponents can exploit them to break free.</h2>
