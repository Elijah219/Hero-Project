        One day, one of her Childhood friends, Rin. Asked her to go to this odd gathering with her. Akane, of course said yes, so when Akane sat down with rin in this abandoned building with seats all surrounding the middle where the light from the city peered through, she was a bit on edge, 
        But hearing the words of the Seraphfall preachers talk about how powers are being kept from the public and should be allowed to everyone, she found herself siding with Seraphfall more and more. 
        As the gather proceeded, she saw the preachers call her friend Rin up to the middle, injecting her with this serum they called CRX-42. 
        Her eyes widened as her friend rin, experienced now enhanced strength, she wanted this strength as well. Once the Ceromony ended, she walked up to the preacher, asking for CRX-42 herself so she could join, the preachers gladly obliged, injecting her, and once she found out she was also compatible with the serum, 
        she decided to join Seraphfall as well.
