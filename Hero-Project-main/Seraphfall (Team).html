      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Seraphfall is full of people devoted to their goal of making a fully super powered world. All of Them Regard those who are not compatible with CRX-42 as not worthy of being in the new world they crave. They view having superpowers as “A gift from god.” </p>

      <h2>Recruitment</h2>
        <p>Seraphfall has “preachers” advertising the benefits of a world full of superpowered people, without mentioning they work for Seraphfall. For anyone who is interested in what is being preached, Seraphfall organizes discret gatherings where they go more in-depth about their goals. Those who are swayed by their words will pledge allegiance to them and then be injected with CRX-42 in front of everyone attending the gathering. If they are incompatible with the serum and suffer death or mutation, they are regarded as a “Husk”. But for those who survive the process are branded with the logo and get introduced to Seraphfalls main headquarters soon after.
