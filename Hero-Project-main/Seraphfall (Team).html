        <h1>Recruitment</h1>
        <p><h3>Seraphfall has “preachers” advertising the benefits of a world full of superpowered people, without mentioning they work for Seraphfall. For anyone who is interested in what is being preached, Seraphfall organizes discret gatherings where they go more in-depth about their goals. Those who are swayed by their words will pledge allegiance to them and then be injected with CRX-42 in front of everyone attending the gathering. If they are incompatible with the serum and suffer death or mutation, they are regarded as a “Husk”. But for those who survive the process are branded with the logo and get introduced to Seraphfalls main headquarters soon after.
