      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Hiro was always a headstrong, and stubborn kid, so when he heard rumors of this group called Serraphfall giving people powers, he wanted some for his self. 
        So as he looked for where he could get into contact with Seraphfall, by sheer coincidence, he saw someone with a blindfold and a logo that said "Seraphfall" in an alleyway, seemingly making a deal with some shady guy in an alleyway. Hiro made his way to the blindfolded man, introducing himself and demanding powers. The blindfolded man chuckled, introducing himself as Shiji and handed Hiro CRX-42. Shinji told Hiro if he could handle the serum he'd allow him to join him in his efforts as well. Hiro smirked at this challenge, without hesitation he injected himself with CRX-42, his body ached, he fell to the floor, it looked like he wasn't going to make it. But by sheer Persistence, he was deemed worthy of CRX-42's effects, stumbling up and proud he showed Shinji he wans't a pushover. 
        Shinji who was impressed by his efforts handed him his business card, for later if he ever wanted to "Further increase his strength."​</p>

      <h2>Powers</h2>
      <p>The villain’s power is rooted in their endless determination. 
        Their abilities manifest as an unbreakable resolve that allows them to withstand physical, emotional, and mental challenges while forcing their enemies to relent through sheer persistence. 
        Whether by healing themselves continuously, outlasting opponents, or wearing down the will of others, this villain is capable of pushing beyond normal limits, refusing to accept defeat.
       ​</p>
      
      <h2>Weakness</h2>
      <p>The more the villain relies on their powers, the more they risk overextending themselves. 
        There is a limit to how much life force they can absorb or how much energy they can siphon. 
        If they push too far, they may temporarily exhaust themselves or become vulnerable</p>
