The moment the scales detect even the slightest imbalance (a pang of guilt, a selfish whisper, a suppressed doubt), bellowing “gavel strikes” echo through the battlefield and sentencing verdicts are delivered in merciless force. ​

        Within a 50-foot radius, every combatant’s heart and mind are scanned. Visible, spectral chains lash out at anyone whose emotional “balance” tilts, however minimally, toward imperfection.​
