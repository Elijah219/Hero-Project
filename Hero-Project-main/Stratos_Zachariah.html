This manifests as a dark, spherical zone around the user or at a targeted location. Anything crossing this zone experiences extreme gravitational distortion, time dilation, or is pulled into a pocket dimension or singularity.</p>
      
      <h2>Weakness</h2>
      <p>Control Limitations: Creating an event horizon is extremely taxing; prolonged use may harm the user. </p>
