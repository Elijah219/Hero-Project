        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>2049, A Material called Feralum was discovered that spread a Virus that re-coded genetic material In living organisms effectively giving them powers but at the cost of turning them into Mutants. 
            The USA took note of this, Creating a Unit Called Stratos Unit. Stratos Unit Turned the Material Into a Serum called CRX-42 that removes the added effect of turning organisms into a mutant and giving them more control over their powers.  
            CRX-42 is not Compatible with everyone, making Stratos Unit very chosy with who gets the serum. 13 years later, Someone in stratos unit rebelled, creating their own unit called Seraphfall Using the formula for CRX-42, Seraphfall started mass producing the Serum, attempting to create a fully superpowered world. 
            6 years from when Seraphfall was made, our main protaginists Senya & Zachariah who are at the top of their class in the stratos unit, and are fierce rivals. Get assigned to the very mission that would change their lives, having run-in with one of the Pillars in Seraphfall.
